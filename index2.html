    The HyperText Markup Language or<u>HTML is the standard markup language</u> for documents designed to be displayed 
    in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies 
    such <b>as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        <b>Html has many rules:</b>Tags are always surrounded by angle brackets (less-than/greater-than characters), as in <HEAD>.
            Most tags come in pairs and surround the material they affect. They work like a light switch: the first tag turns the action on, and the second turns it off. (There are some exceptions. For instance, the <BR> tag creates a blank line and doesn’t have an “off switch.” Once you’ve made a line break, you can’t unmake it.)
            The second tag the “off switch” always starts with a forward slash. For example, you turn on bold with <B>, shout your piece, and then go back to regular text with </B>.
            First tag on, last tag off. Tags are embedded, so when you start a tag within another tag, you have to close that inner tag before closing the outer tag. For instance, the page will not display properly with the tags in this order:

        <b>Sematic Html</b>
    <dd>Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the encoded information over its presentation (look). 
        HTML has included semantic markup from its inception,[84] but has also included presentational markup, such as <font>, <i> 
        and <center> tags.
        There are also the semantically neutral div and span tags. Since the late 1990s, when Cascading Style Sheets were beginning 
        to work in most browsers, web authors have been encouraged to avoid the use of presentational HTML markup with a view to the 
        separation of content and presentation.[85]

        <p>In a 2001 discussion of the Semantic Web, Tim Berners-Lee and others gave examples of ways in which intelligent software 
        "agents" may one day automatically crawl the web and find, filter, and correlate previously unrelated, published facts for 
        the benefit of human users.[86] Such agents are not commonplace even now, but some of the ideas of Web 2.0, mashups and price
        comparison websites may be coming close.
        The main difference between these web application hybrids and Berners-Lee's semantic agents lies in the fact that the current
        aggregation and hybridization of information is usually designed by web developers, who already know the web locations and the 
        API semantics of the specific data they wish to mash, compare and combine.</p>
        
        An important type of web agent that does crawl and read web pages automatically, without prior knowledge of what it might find, 
        is the web crawler or search-engine spider.<br/>These software agents are dependent on the semantic clarity of web pages they find 
        as they use various techniques and algorithms to read and index millions of web pages a day and provide web users with search
         facilities without which the World Wide Web's usefulness would be greatly reduced.<br/>
        
        In order for search engine spiders to be able to rate the significance of pieces of text they find in HTML documents, and also 
        for those creating mashups and other hybrids as well as for more automated agents as they are developed, the semantic structures 
        that exist in HTML need to be widely and uniformly applied to bring out the meaning of the published text.[87]
        
        Presentational markup tags are deprecated in current HTML and XHTML recommendations. 
        The majority of presentational features from previous versions of HTML are no longer allowed as they lead to poorer accessibility, 
        higher cost of site maintenance, and larger document sizes.[88]
        
        <small>Good semantic HTML also improves the accessibility of web documents (see also Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). For example,
         when a screen reader or audio browser can correctly ascertain the structure of a document, it will not waste the visually impaired user's 
         time by reading out repeated or irrelevant information when it has been marked up correctly.</small>
